# BYOE: Bring Your Own Event
[JSFest.Berlin](http://jsfest.berlin) is **your** festival – a full week of events for and by the JavaScript community in Berlin. You or your company are welcome to organize your own event, and submit the details to our schedule. We’ll promote your event just as we promote the others.

## What makes a good JSFest.Berlin event?
We welcome learning and professional development workshops, social events, charitable activities, hackathons, doc sprints, open office hours or tours, meetups, job fairs, flash mobs ... if you think JS developers and their friends would enjoy it, pitch it.

## Pitch your event by [submitting a pull request](https://github.com/rmehner/jsfest.berlin)
In your PR, provide all the established details, including the date and times, location, and a link to learn more. In the description of the PR, name all the organizers, state the cost if any, and the maximum number of registrants. We will follow up via the PR.
